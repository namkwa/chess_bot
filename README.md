white to play, look if any black piece can check or pin by simulating the all the pieces moves from the king, if there is a check here a the solution for each type piece:

-bishop/rook/queen test if a piece can come in the diagonal/row by testing all the emplacements in those row/diagonals as well as moving the king from this position
-probably same method for knight
-definitely same method for pawn

if there is no checks from black just simulate all the moves
